As it's build with kivy , the android app can be quite easily deployed using buildozer.
Steps --->
In a Linux based terminal -
1⟩ In terminal , execute 'buildozer init'.
2⟩ Configure the buildozer file (Add the requirements, name the app, add icon,etc).
3⟩ In terminal execute, 'buildozer -v android debug'

**If on windows, its better to move the project to Linux partiton as it will consume far less time.
